To compile the project and create the sample jars do
 mvn package
you should see a example-plugins.jar in the target directory.

The hello world plugin will add a method to the frame class that prints hello world.
The word-count plugin will add a method to the frame class that counts words in the frame.
The vertex-degree count plugin will add a method to the graph class that counts the vertex out-degree.

To register the plugins with the Analytics Toolkit, update the following configuration files:
src/main/resources/atk-module.conf
src/main/resources/atk-plugin.conf

Installing plugins:

To add the plugins to your current installation of trusted analytics copy the example-plugins.jar to
/usr/lib/trustedanalytics/lib/.  Plugins should go in a jar with "plugins" in the name of the jar.

Now restart the trusted analytics service and try the code example below.

sudo service trustedanalytics restart


Sample code:

from trustedanalytics import *

#the default home directory is  hdfs://user/atkuser all the sample data sets are saved to hdfs://user/atkuser/datasets
dataset = r"datasets/movie_data_random.csv"

#csv schema definition
schema = [("user_id", int32),
          ("movie_id", int32),
          ("rating", int32),
          ("splits", str)]

csv_file = CsvFile(dataset, schema, skip_header_lines=1)

print "Building data frame"

frame = Frame(csv_file)

print "View auto-generated Python documentation for plugin"
help(frame.helloworld)

print "Run hello-world plugin"
frame.helloworld()
>>u'Frame says Hello World'

frame.helloworld("test")
>> u'Frame says test'

More examples are available in the python-examples folder.
