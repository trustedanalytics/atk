Overview
--------

|PACKAGE| is a platform that simplifies applying :term:`graph analytics` and
:term:`machine learning` to big data for superior knowledge discovery and
predictive modeling across a wide variety of use cases and solutions.
|PACKAGE| provides an analytics pipeline (|ATK|) spanning feature engineering, graph
construction, graph analytics, and machine learning using an extensible,
modular framework.
By unifying graph and entity-based machine learning, machine learning
developers can incorporate an entity's nearby relationships to yield superior
predictive models that better represent the contextual information in the data.
All functionality operates at full scale, yet are accessed using a higher level
Python data science programming abstraction to significantly ease the
complexity of cluster computing and parallel processing.
The platform is fully extensible through a plugin architecture that allows
incorporating the full range of analytics and machine learning for any solution
need in a unified workflow that frees the researchers from the overhead of
understanding, integrating, and inefficiently iterating across a diversity of
formats and interfaces.


--------------------------------------------
Python and Data Frame User Interface Summary
--------------------------------------------

|ATK| utilizes Python data science abstractions to make programming fully
scalable big data analytic workflows using Spark/Hadoop clusters as familiar
and accessible as using popular desktop machine learning solutions such as
Pandas and SciKit Learn.
The scalable data frame representation is more familiar and intuitive to data
researchers compared to low level HDFS file and Spark RDD formats.
|ATK| provides an extensive library to manipulate the data frames for
feature engineering and exploration, such as joins and aggregations.
User-defined transformations and filters can be written in Python and applied
to terabytes (and more) of data using distributed processing.
Machine learning algorithms are also invoked as higher-level data science API
(Application Programming Interface) abstractions, making model development
(such as creating parallel recommender systems or training classifier and
clustering models) accessible to a broad population of researchers possessing
mainstream data science programming skills.
For more information, see the section on :doc:`process flow </ds_dflw>`
and the `Python website <http://www.python.org>`__.

Graph Pipeline Summary
----------------------

In addition to enabling use of entity-based data representations and
algorithms, the toolkit provides a full graph pipeline to enable application of
graph methods to big data.
Graph representations are broadly useful, for example to link disparate data
using arbitrary edge types, and then analyze the connections for powerful
predictive signals that can otherwise be missed with entity-based methods.
Working with graph representations can often be more intuitive and
computationally efficient for data sets where the connections between data
observations are more numerous and more important than the data points alone.
|ATK| offers a representation of graph data as fully-scalable property
graph objects with vertices, edges, and associated properties.
The pipeline brings together into one workflow all the capabilities to create
and analyze graph objects, including engineering features, linking data,
performing rich traversal queries, and applying graph-based algorithms.
Because data scientists often need to iterate analysis using both graph and
frame representations (for example, applying a clustering algorithm to a vertex
list with features developed using graph analytics), |ATK| provides the
seamless ability to move between both data representations.


-----------------------
Graph Analytics Summary
-----------------------

Fully-scalable graph analytic algorithms are provided for uncovering central
influences and communities in the data set.
This ability is useful for exploring the data, as well as for incorporating as
machine learning features that incorporate the context of an entity in the
graph, thus creating better, more predictive, machine learning results.


------------------------
Machine Learning Summary
------------------------

The toolkit provides algorithms for supervised, unsupervised, and
semi-supervised machine learning using both entity and graphical machine
learning tools.
Graph machine learning algorithms such as label propagation and loopy belief
propagation, exploit the connections in the graph structure and provide
powerful new methods of labeling or classifying graph data.
Examples of other machine learning capabilities provided include recommender
systems using alternating least squares and conjugate gradient descent, topic
modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, clustering using K-means, and
classification using logistic regression.
See the section on :doc:`machine learning </ds_ml>` and the
:doc:`API </python_api/index>` for further information.

--------------
Scoring Engine
--------------

The scoring engine produces predictions from inputs using a previously trained machine learning model. Once a model has been trained and evaluated, it can be deployed easily into production via the scoring engine.

---------------
Plugins Summary
---------------

In addition to the extensive set of capabilities provided, the platform is
fully extensible using a plugin architecture.
This allows developers to incorporate graph analytical tools into the existing
range of machine learning abilities, expanding the capabilities of |PACKAGE|
for new problem solutions.
Plugins are developed using a thin Scala wrapper, and the |ATK| framework
automatically generates a Python presentation for those added functions.
Plug-ins can be used for a range of purposes, such as developing custom
algorithms for specialized data types, building custom transformations for
commonly used functions to get higher performance than a |UDF|, or integrating
other tools to further unify the workflow.
See the :doc:`Plugin Authoring Guide </dev_plug>` for more information.
