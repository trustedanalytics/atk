    Adjacency List

        A representation of a graph as a list.
        Each line of the list consists of a unique vertex identification, and
        a list of all of that vertex's neighboring vertices.

        Example::

              Node   Connection List
            /------------------------/
               A         B, D
               B         A, C, D
               C         B
               D         A, B

    Alternating Least Squares

        A method used in some approaches to multidimensional scaling, where a
        goodness-of-fit measure for some data is minimized in a series of
        steps, each involving the application of the :term:`least squares`
        method of parameter estimation.

        See the API section on the
        :ref:`Collaborative Filter Model <python_api/models/model-collaborative_filtering/index>`
        for an in-depth discussion of this method.

    API Maturity Tags

        Functions in the API may be at different levels of software maturity.
        Where a function is not mature, the documentation will note it with one
        of the following tags.  The absence of a tag means the function is
        standardized and fully tested.

        [ALPHA] Indicates a function or feature which has been developed, but
        has not been completely tested.
        Use this function with caution.
        This function may be changed or eliminated in future releases.

        [BETA] Indicates a function or feature which has been developed and
        preliminarily tested, but has not been completely tested.
        Use this function with caution.
        This function may be changed in future releases.

        [DEPRECATED] Indicates a function or feature which is no longer
        supported.
        It is recommended that an alternate solution be found.
        This function may be removed in future releases.

    Beta

        See :term:`API Maturity Tags`.

    Bias-variance trade-off

        In supervised classifier training, the problem of minimizing two
        sources of prediction error: erroneous assumptions in the learning
        algorithm, and sensitivity to small details in the training data (in
        other words, over-fitting) when generalizing to a testing data set.

    Bias vs Variance

        In this context, "bias" means accuracy, while "variance" means
        accounting for outlier data points.

    Central Tendency

        A typical value for a probability distribution.
        It may also be called a center or location of the distribution.
        Colloquially, measures of central tendency are often called averages.

    Centrality

        From `Wikipedia\: Centrality`_:

            In graph theory and network analysis, centrality of a vertex
            measures its relative importance within a graph.
            Applications include how influential a person is within a social
            network, how important a room is within a building (space syntax),
            and how well-used a road is within an urban network.
            There are four main measures of centrality: degree, betweenness,
            closeness, and eigenvector.
            Centrality concepts were first developed in social network analysis,
            and many of the terms used to measure centrality reflect their
            sociological origin. [#f10]_

        character.
        New line characters are usually used for this purpose.
        Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by some unique
        character.

        Plural form of :term:`Confusion Matrix`

    Confusion Matrix

        In machine learning, a table describing the performance of a
        supervised classification algorithm, in which each column corresponds
        to instances of a predicted class, while each row represents the
        instances of the true class.
        Also known as contingency table, error matrix, or misclassification
        matrix.

    Conjugate Gradient Descent

        |PACKAGE| implements this algorithm.
        Specifically, it uses CGD with bias for collaborative filtering.

    Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

        In mathematics and computer science, a graph formed by a collection of
        vertices and directed edges, each edge connecting one vertex to
        another, such that there is no way to start at some vertex :math:`v`
        and follow a sequence of edges that eventually loops back to :math:`v`
        again.

        Contrast with :term:`Undirected Graph`.

        See `Wikipedia\: Directed Acyclic Graph`_.

    ECDF

        See :term:`Empirical Cumulative Distribution`

    Edge

        A connection |EM| either directed or not |EM| between two vertices in a
        graph.

    Enumerate

        Verb |EM| To specify each member of a sequence individually in incrementing order.

    Equal Width Binning

        Equal width binning places column values into groups such that the
        values in each group fall within the same interval and the interval
        width for each group is equal.

    Equal Depth Binning

        Equal depth binning places column values into groups such
        that each group contains the same number of elements.

    Empirical Cumulative Distribution

        :math:`\hat F_{n}(t)` is a step function with jumps :math:`i/n` at
        observation values, where :math:`i` is the number of tied observations
        at that value.
        Missing values are ignored.

        For observations :math:`x = (x_{1},x_{2}, ... x_{n})`,
        :math:`\hat F_{n}(t)` is the fraction of observations less than or
        equal to :math:`t`.

        .. math::

            \hat F_{n}(t) = \frac {x_{i} \le t}{n} = \frac {1}{n} \
            \sum_{i=1}^{n} Indicator\{x_{i} \le t\}.

        where :math:`Indicator\{A\}` is the indicator of event :math:`A`.
        For a fixed :math:`t`, the indicator :math:`Indicator\{x_{i} \le t\}`
        is a Bernoulli random variable with parameter :math:`p = F(t)`, hence
        :math:`n \hat F_{n}(t)` is a binomial random variable with mean
        :math:`n F(t)` and variance :math:`n F(t)(1 - F(t))`.
        This implies that :math:`\hat F_{n}(t)` is an unbiased estimator for
        :math:`F(t)`.

    Extract, Transform, and Load

        From `Wikipedia\: Extract, Transform, and Load`_:

            In computing, |ETL| refers to a process in database usage and
            especially in data warehousing that:

            *   Extracts data from outside sources
            *   Transforms it to fit operational needs, which can include
                quality levels
            *   Loads it into the end target (database, more specifically,
                operational data store, data mart, or data warehouse)

            |ETL| systems are commonly used to integrate data from multiple
            applications, typically developed and supported by different
            vendors or hosted on separate computer hardware.
            The disparate systems containing the original data are frequently
            managed and operated by different employees.
            For example a cost accounting system may combine data from
            payroll, sales and purchasing.

        See :term:`F-Measure`.

    F-Measure

        In machine learning, a metric that quantifies a classifier's accuracy.
        Traditionally defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
        Also known as F1 score.

    GaBP

        See :term:`Gaussian Belief Propagation`.

    Gaussian Belief Propagation

        A special case of belief propagation when the underlying distributions
        are :term:`Gaussian <gaussian distribution>` (Weiss & Freeman [#f11]_).

    Gaussian Distribution
    Normal Distribution

        A group of values, where the probability of any specific value:

        *   will fall between two real limits,
        *   is evenly centered around the mean,
        *   approaches zero on either side of the mean.

        A Gaussian distribution is defined as:

        .. math::

            f(x, \mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{ \sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \
            e^{-i \frac{(x-i \mu)^{2}}{2i \sigma^2}}

        *   :math:`\mu` is the mean of the distribution.
        *   :math:`\sigma` is the standard deviation.


    Gaussian Random Fields

        A random group of vertices displaying a :term:`Gaussian distribution`
        of one or more sets of properties.

    Global Clustering Coefficient

        The global clustering coefficient is based on triplets of vertices.
        A triplet consists of three vertices that are connected by either two
        (open triplet) or three (closed triplet) undirected edges.
        A triangle consists of three closed triplets, one centered on each of
        the vertices.
        The global clustering coefficient is the number of closed triplets
        (or 3 x triangles) over the total number of triplets (both open and
        closed).

        For more information see: `Wikipedia\: Global Clustering Coefficient
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient#Global_clustering_coefficient>`__.

        See also :term:`Local Clustering Coefficient`.

    Graph

        A representation of a set of vertices, where some pairs of objects are
        connected by edges.
        The links that connect some pairs of vertices are called edges.
        Typically, a graph is depicted in diagrammatic form as a set of dots
        for the vertices, joined by lines or curves for the edges.
        Graphs are one of the objects of study in discrete mathematics.

        For more information see: `Wikipedia\: Graph (mathematics)`_.

    Graph Analytics

        The broad category of methods used to examine the statistical and
        structural properties of a graph, including:

        #.  Traversals --
            Algorithmic walk-through of the graph to determine optimal
            paths and relationship between vertices.

        #.  Statistics --
            Important attributes of the graph such as degrees of
            separation, number of triangular counts, centralities (highly
            influential nodes), and so on.

        Some are user-guided interactions, where the user navigates through
        the data connections, others are algorithmic, where a result is
        calculated by the software.

        Graph learning is a class of graph analytics applying machine learning
        and data mining algorithms to graph data.
        This means that calculations are iterated across the nodes of the
        graph to uncover patterns and relationships.
        Thus, finding similarities based on relationships, or recursively
        optimizing some parameter across nodes.

        For more information, see the article
        `Graph Analytics <http://vacommunity.org/article26>`__
        by Pak Chung Wong.

    Graph Database Directions

        As a shorthand, graph database terminology uses relative directions,
        assumed to be from whatever vertex you are currently using.
        These directions are:

        *    **left**: The calling frame's index
        *    **right**: The input frame's index
        *    **inner**: An intersection of indexes

        So a direction like this: "The suffix to use from the left frame's
        overlapping columns" means to use the suffix from the calling frame's
        index.

    Graph Element

        A graph element is an object that can have any number of key-value
        pairs, that is, properties, associated with it.
        Each element can have zero properties as well.

    Gremlin

        A graph query language.
        Gremlin works with the Titan Graph Database, though it is made by a
        different company.
        For more information see: `Gremlin Wiki`_.

    HBase

        Apache HBase is the Hadoop database, a distributed, scalable, big data
        store.

    Hyperparameter

        Parameter that describe the prior distribution (the assumption about
        the data before observing it) as opposed to the parameters that govern
        the underlying system.

        In particular, for Latent Dirichlet Allocation:

        Alpha is the parameter of the Dirichlet "prior" on the per-document
        distribution of words.
        In other words, how the distribution of words per
        document is modeled before seeing any data. 

        Beta is the parameter of the Dirichlet "prior" on the per-topic word
        distribution.
        In other words, how the distribution of words per
        topic is modeled before seeing any data.

    int32

        An integer is a member of the set of positive whole numbers {1, 2,
        3, . . . }, negative whole numbers {-1, -2, -3, . . . }, and zero {0}.
        Since a computer is limited, the computer representation of it can
        have 32 bits of precision.

    int64

        An integer is a member of the set of positive whole numbers {1, 2,
        3, . . . }, negative whole numbers {-1, -2, -3, . . . }, and zero {0}.
        Since a computer is limited, the computer representation of it can
        have 64 bits of precision.

    Ising Smoothing Parameter

        The smoothing parameter in the Ising model.
        For more information see: `Wikipedia\: Ising Model`_.

        You can use any positive float number, so 3, 2.5, 1, or 0.7 are all
        valid values.
        A larger smoothing value implies stronger relationships between
        adjacent random variables in the graph.

    JSON

        Data in the JavaScript Object Notation format. An open standard format
        that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of
        attribute/value pairs. For more information see `http:/json.org`__.

    Katz Centrality

        From `Wikipedia\: Katz Centrality`_:

            In Social Network Analysis (SNA) there are various measures of
            :term:`centrality` which determine the relative importance of an
            actor (or node) within the network.
            Katz centrality was introduced by Leo Katz in 1953 and is used to
            measure the degree of influence of an actor in a social network.
            [#f8]_
            Unlike typical centrality measures which consider only the shortest
            path (the geodesic) between a pair of actors, Katz centrality
            measures influence by taking into account the total number of walks
            between a pair of actors. [#f9]_

    |K-S| Test

        From `Wikipedia\: Kolmogorov|EM|Smirnov Test`_:

            In statistics, the |K-S| test is a nonparametric test of the
            equality of continuous, one-dimensional probability distributions
            that can be used to compare a sample with a reference probability
            distribution (one-sample |K-S| test), or to compare two samples
            (two-sample |K-S| test).
            The |K-S| statistic quantifies a distance between the empirical
            distribution function of the sample and the cumulative distribution
            function of the reference distribution, or between the empirical
            distribution functions of two samples.

    Label Propagation

        A multi-pass process for grouping vertices.

        See :ref:`Label Propagation (LP) <python_api/frames/frame-/label_propagation>`.

        For additional reference:
        `Learning from Labeled and Unlabeled Data with Label Propagation`_.

    Labeled Data vs Unlabeled Data

        From `Wikipedia\: Machine Learning / Algorithm Types`_:

            Supervised learning algorithms are trained on labeled examples, in
            other words, input where the desired output is known.
            While Unsupervised learning algorithms operate on unlabeled
            examples, in other words, input where the desired output is
            unknown.

        Many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabeled data, when
        used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data, can produce
        considerable improvement in learning accuracy.

        For more information see: `Wikipedia\: Semi-Supervised Learning`_.

    Lambda

        Adapted from: `Stanford\: Machine Learning`_:

            This is the trade-off parameter, used in :term:`Label Propagation`
            on :term:`Gaussian Random Fields`.
            The regularization parameter is a control on fitting parameters.
            It is used in machine learning algorithms to prevent over-fitting.
            As the magnitude of the fitting parameter increases, there will be
            an increasing penalty on the cost function.
            This penalty is dependent on the squares of the parameters as well
            as the magnitude of lambda.

    Lambda Function

        An anonymous function or function literal in code.
        Lambda functions are used when a method requires a function as an input
        parameter and the function is coded directly in the method call.

        Further examples and explanations can be found at this page:
        :doc:`/ds_apir`.

        Related term: :term:`Python User-defined Function`.

        .. warning:: This term is often used where a :term:`Python user-defined
            function` is more accurate.
            A key distinction is that the lambda function is not referable by a
            name.

    Latent Dirichlet Allocation

        From `Wikipedia\: Latent Dirichlet Allocation`_:

            [A] generative model that allows sets of observations to be
            explained by unobserved groups that explain why some parts of the
            data are similar.
            For example, if observations are words collected into documents,
            it posits that each document is a mixture of a small number of
            topics and that each word's creation is attributable to one of the
            document's topics.
            |LDA| is an example of a topic model and was first presented as a
            graphical model for topic discovery by David Blei, Andrew Ng,
            and Michael Jordan in 2003.

    Least Squares

        A mathematical procedure for finding the best-fitting curve to a given
        set of points by minimizing the sum of the squares of the offsets ("the
        residuals") of the points from the curve.
        The sum of the squares of the offsets is used instead of the offset
        absolute values because this allows the residuals to be treated as a
        continuous differentiable quantity.
        However, because squares of the offsets are used, outlying points can
        have a disproportionate effect on the fit, a property which may or may
        not be desirable depending on the problem at hand.

    LineFile

        A data format where the records are line-delimited.

    Local Clustering Coefficient

        The local clustering coefficient of a vertex in a graph quantifies how
        close its neighbors are to being a clique (complete graph).

        For more information see: `Wikipedia\: Local Clustering Coefficient
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient#Local_clustering_coefficient>`__.

        See also :term:`Global Clustering Coefficient`.

    Loopy Belief Propagation

        Belief Propagation is an algorithm that makes inferences on graph
        models, like a :term:`Bayesian inference` or :term:`Markov Random
        Fields`.
        It is called Loopy when the algorithm runs iteratively until
        convergence.

        For more information see: `Wikipedia\: Belief Propagation`_.

    Machine Learning

        Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence.
        It is about constructing and studying software that can "learn" from
        data.
        The more iterations the software computes, the better it gets at making
        that calculation.
        For more information, see `Wikipedia
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning>`__.

    MapReduce

        MapReduce is a programming model for processing large data sets with a
        parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster.
        It is composed of a map() procedure that performs filtering and sorting
        (such as sorting students by first name into queues, one queue for each
        name) and a reduce() procedure that performs a summary operation (such
        as counting the number of students in each queue, yielding name
        frequencies).
        The "MapReduce System" (also called "infrastructure" or "framework")
        orchestrates by marshaling the distributed servers, running the various
        tasks in parallel, managing all communications and data transfers
        between the various parts of the system, and providing for redundancy
        and fault tolerance.

        For more information see: `Wikipedia\: MapReduce`_.

    Markov Random Fields

        Markov Random fields, or Markov Network, are an undirected graph model
        that may be cyclic.
        This contrasts with :term:`Bayesian inference`, which is directed and
        acyclic.

        For more information see: `Wikipedia\: Markov Random Field`_.

    OLAP

        Online analytical processing.
        An approach to answering |MDA| queries swiftly.
        The term |OLAP| was created as a slight modification of the traditional
        database term |OLTP|.

        For more information see: `Wikipedia\: Online analytical processing`_.

    OLTP

        Online transaction processing.
        A class of information systems that facilitate and manage
        transaction-oriented applications.
        |OLTP| involves gathering input information, processing the information
        and updating existing information to reflect the gathered and processed
        information.

        For more information see: `Wikipedia\: Online transaction processing`_.

    PageRank

        An algorithm to measure the importance of vertices.

        PageRank works by counting the number and quality of edges to a vertex
        to determine a rough estimate of how important the vertex is.
        The underlying assumption is that more important vertices are likely to
        have more edges from other vertices.

        For more information see: `Wikipedia\: PageRank`_.

    PageRank Centrality

        See :term:`Centrality`.

    Precision/Recall

        From `Wikipedia\: Precision and Recall`_:

            In pattern recognition and information retrieval with binary
            classification, precision (also called positive predictive value) is
            the fraction of retrieved instances that are relevant, while recall
            (also known as sensitivity) is the fraction of relevant instances
            that are retrieved.
            Both precision and recall are therefore based on an understanding
            and measure of relevance.

    Property Map

        A property map is a key-value map.
        Both edges and vertices have property maps.

        For more information see: `Tinkerpop\: Property Graph Model`_.

    Python User-defined Function

        A Python User-defined Function (UDF) is a Python function written by
        the user on the client-side which can execute in a distributed fashion
        on the cluster.
        For further explanation, see :doc:`/ds_apir`

        Further examples and explanations can be found at :doc:`/ds_apir`.

        Related: :term:`Lambda Function`.


    Quantile

        One value of a set that partitions a collection of data.
        Each partition (also known as a quantile) contains all the collection
        elements from the given value, up to (but not including) the lowest
        value of the next quantile.

    Receiver Operating Characteristic

        From `Wikipedia\: Receiver Operating Characteristic`_:

            In signal detection theory, a receiver operating characteristic
            (ROC), or simply ROC curve, is a graphical plot which illustrates
            the performance of a binary classifier system as its discrimination
            threshold is varied.
            It is created by plotting the fraction of true positives out of the
            total actual positives (TPR = true positive rate) vs. the fraction
            of false positives out of the total actual negatives (FPR = false
            positive rate), at various threshold settings.
            TPR is also known as sensitivity or recall in machine learning.
            The FPR is also known as the fall-out and can be calculated as one
            minus the more well known specificity.
            The ROC curve is then the sensitivity as a function of fall-out.
            In general, if both of the probability distributions for detection
            and false alarm are known,
            the ROC curve can be generated by plotting the Cumulative
            Distribution Function (area under the probability distribution from
            -inf to +inf) of the detection probability in the y-axis versus the
            Cumulative Distribution Function of the false alarm probability in
            x-axis.

    Recommendation Systems

        From `Wikipedia\: Recommender System`_:

            Recommender systems or recommendation systems (sometimes replacing
            "system" with a synonym such as platform or engine) are a subclass
            of information filtering system that seek to predict the 'rating'
            or 'preference' that user would give to an item [#f3]_ [#f4]_ .


    Resource Description Framework

        A specific format for storing graphs.
        Vertices also referred to as resources, have property/value pairs
        describing the resource.
        A vertex is any object which can be pointed to by a URI.
        Properties are attributes of the vertex, and values are either specific
        values for the attribute, or the URI for another vertex.
        For example, information in a particular vertex, might include the
        property "Author".
        The value for the Author property could be either a string giving the
        name of the author, or a link to another resource describing the author.
        Sets of properties are defined within RDF Vocabularies (or schemas).
        A vertex may include properties defined in different schemas.
        The properties within a resource description are associated with a
        certain schema definition using the XML namespace mechanism.

    Semi-Supervised Learning

        In Semi-Supervised learning algorithms, most the input data are not
        labeled and a small amount are labeled.
        The expectation is that the software "learns" to calculate faster than
        in either supervised or unsupervised algorithms.

        For more information see: :term:`Supervised Learning`, and
        :term:`Unsupervised Learning`.

    Schema

        A computer structure that defines the structure of something else.

    Simple Random Sampling

        In statistics, a simple random sample (SRS) is a subset of individuals
        (a sample) chosen from a larger set (a population).
        Each individual is chosen randomly and entirely by chance, such that
        each individual has the same probability of being chosen at any stage
        during the sampling process, and each subset of *k* individuals has the
        same probability of being chosen for the sample as any other subset of
        *k* individuals [#f1]_.
        This process and technique is known as simple random sampling.
        A simple random sample is an unbiased surveying technique.

        For more information see: `Wikipedia\: Simple Random Sample`_.

    Smoothing

        Smoothing means to reduce the "noise" in a data set.
        "In smoothing, the data points of a signal are modified so individual
        points (presumably because of noise) are reduced, and points that are
        lower than the adjacent points are increased leading to a smoother
        signal."

        For more information see:

            | `Wikipedia\: Smoothing`_
            | `Wikipedia\: Relaxation (iterative method)`_

    Stratified Sampling

        In statistics, stratified sampling is a method of sampling from a
        population.
        In statistical surveys, when subpopulations within an overall
        population vary, it is advantageous to sample each subpopulation
        (stratum) independently.
        Stratification is the process of dividing members of the population
        into homogeneous subgroups before sampling.
        The strata should be mutually exclusive: every element in the
        population must be assigned to only one stratum.
        The strata should also be collectively exhaustive: no population
        element can be excluded.
        Then simple random sampling or systematic sampling is applied within
        each stratum.
        This often improves the representativeness of the sample by reducing
        sampling error.
        It can produce a weighted mean that has less variability than the
        arithmetic mean of a simple random sample of the population.

        For more information see: `Wikipedia\: Stratified Sampling`_.

    Supervised Learning

        Supervised learning refers to algorithms where the input data are all
        labeled, and the outcome of the calculation is known.
        These algorithms train the software to make a certain calculation.

    Topic Modeling

        Topic models provide a simple way to analyze large volumes of unlabeled
        text.
        A "topic" consists of a cluster of words that frequently occur together.
        Using contextual clues, topic models can connect words with similar
        meanings and distinguish between uses of words with multiple meanings.

    Transaction Processing

        From `Wikipedia\: Transaction Processing`_:

            In computer science, transaction processing is information
            processing that is divided into individual, indivisible operations,
            called transactions.
            Each transaction must succeed or fail as a complete unit; it cannot
            be only partially complete.

    Transactional Functionality

        See :term:`Transaction Processing`.

    UDF

        See :term:`Python User-defined Function`.

    Undirected Graph

        An undirected graph is one in which the edges have no orientation
        (direction).
        The edge (a, b) is identical to the edge (b, a), in other words,
        they are not ordered pairs, but sets {u, v} (or 2-multisets) of
        vertices.
        The maximum number of edges in an undirected graph without a self-loop
        is :math:`\dfrac{n (n - 1)}{2}`

        Contrast with :term:`Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)`.

        For more information see: `Wikipedia\: Undirected Graph`_.

    Unicode

        A data type consisting of a string of characters designed to represent
        all characters in the world, a universal character set.

    Unsupervised Learning

        Unsupervised learning refers to algorithms where the input data are not
        labeled, and the outcome of the calculation is unknown.
        In this case, the software needs to "learn" how to make the calculation.

        For more information see: :term:`Supervised Learning`, and
        :term:`Semi-Supervised Learning`.

    Vertex

        A vertex is an object in a graph.
        Each vertex has an ID and a property map.
        In Giraph, a long integer is used as ID for each vertex.
        The property map may contain 0 or more properties.
        Each vertex is connected to others by edges.

        For more information see: :term:`Edge`, and
        `Tinkerpop\: Property Graph Model`_.

    Vertex Degree

        From `Wikipedia\: Vertex Degree`_:

            In graph theory, the degree (or valency) of a vertex of a graph is
            the number of edges incident to the vertex, with loops counted
            twice [#f7]_.
            The degree of a vertex :math:`v` is denoted :math:`\deg(v)`.
            The maximum degree of a graph :math:`G`, denoted by
            :math:`\Delta(G)`,
            and the minimum degree of a graph, denoted by :math:`\delta(G)`, are
            the maximum and minimum degree of its vertices.

    Vertex Degree Distribution

        From `Wikipedia\: Degree Distribution`_:

            In the study of graphs and networks, the degree of a node in a
            network is the number of connections it has to other nodes and the
            degree distribution is the probability distribution of these
            degrees over the whole network.

    Vertices

        Plural form of :term:`Vertex`.
