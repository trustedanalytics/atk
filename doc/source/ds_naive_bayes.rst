Naive Bayes
===========

Naive Bayes is a basic classifier.

Setup
-----

Establish a connection to the ATK Rest Server
This handle will be used for the remaineder of the script

Get your server URL and credentials file from the TAP administrator

.. code::

   atk_server_uri = os.getenv("ATK_SERVER_URI", ia.server.uri)
   credentials_file = os.getenv("ATK_CREDENTIALS", "")

Set the server, and use the credentials to connect to the ATK

.. code::

   ia.server.uri = atk_server_uri
   ia.connect(credentials_file)

Workflow
--------

The general workflow will be build a frame, build a model, train the model on the frame, predict using the model, evaluate the results using classification metrics.

Build a Frame
-------------

Construct a frame to be uploaded, this is done using Python lists uploaded to the server

Each row represents a sample from a probability distribution, with a vector associated with a category. For the purposes of this example there are two categories (e.g. cat and dog) and three features to indicate whether the sample is a cat or a dog (weight, height, fur type)

The frame has the schema Class, feature 1, feature 2, feature 3, where class is the category that the sample belongs to

.. code::

   rows_frame = ia.UploadRows([[0,1,0,0],
                               [0,2,0,0],
                               [1,0,1,0],
                               [1,0,2,0]],
                              [("class", ia.float32),
                               ("f1", ia.int32),
                               ("f2", ia.int32),
                               ("f3", ia.int32)])

   frame = ia.Frame(rows_frame)

   print frame.inspect()

Build a Model
-------------

        nb_model = ia.NaiveBayesModel()

Train the model on the frame, this is supervised training technique so the category is used in the training process. Note the feature vector is represented as a list of column names.

.. code::

   nb_model.train(frame, "class", ["f1", "f2", "f3"])

Predict assigns a category to a sample in the feature space
        # For the purposes of illustrating the workflow, I am predicting on the
        # same frame used to train, normally you would predict on a different
        # frame representing data that didn't have a category assigned to it

        # again note the feature vector is a python list of column names
        result = nb_model.predict(frame, ["f1", "f2", "f3"])

        # The result is a frame with a new "predicted_class" column
        print result.inspect()

        # Run classification metrics on the resultant frame to understand
        # model performance
        cm = result.classification_metrics("class", "predicted_class")

        print cm

        # Assert the results are correct
        self.assertEqual(cm.confusion_matrix.values[0][0],2)
        self.assertEqual(cm.confusion_matrix.values[1][1],2)
        self.assertEqual(cm.confusion_matrix.values[0][1],0)
        self.assertEqual(cm.confusion_matrix.values[1][0],0)
