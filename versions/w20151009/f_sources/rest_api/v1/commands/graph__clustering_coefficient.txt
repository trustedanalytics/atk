:arguments:


    **graph** : <bound method AtkEntityType.__name__ of <trustedanalytics.rest.jsonschema.AtkEntityType object at 0x7f02b5926810>>

    ..

        <Missing Description>



    **output_property_name** : unicode (default=None)

    ..

        The name of the new property to which each
        vertex's local clustering coefficient will be written.
        If this option is not specified, no output frame will be produced and only
        the global clustering coefficient will be returned.



    **input_edge_labels** : list (default=None)

    ..

        If this list is provided,
        only edges whose labels are included in the given
        set will be considered in the clustering coefficient calculation.
        In the default situation (when no list is provided), all edges will be used
        in the calculation, regardless of label.
        It is required that all edges that enter into the clustering coefficient
        analysis be undirected.

**Description**

Calculates the clustering coefficient of the graph with respect to an (optional) set of labels.

Pulls graph from underlying store, calculates degrees and writes them into the property specified,
and then writes the output graph to the underlying store.

.. warning::

    THIS FUNCTION IS FOR UNDIRECTED GRAPHS.
    If it is called on a directed graph, its output is NOT guaranteed to calculate
    the local directed clustering coefficients.

**Clustering Coefficients**

The clustering coefficient of a graph provides a measure of how tightly
clustered an undirected graph is.
Informally, if the edge relation denotes "friendship", the clustering
coefficient of the graph is the probability that two people are friends given
that they share a common friend.

More formally:

.. math::

    cc(G)  = \frac{ \| \{ (u,v,w) \in V^3: \ \{u,v\}, \{u, w\}, \{v,w \} \in \
    E \} \| }{\| \{ (u,v,w) \in V^3: \ \{u,v\}, \{u, w\} \in E \} \|}


Analogously, the clustering coefficient of a vertex provides a measure of how
tightly clustered that vertex's neighborhood is.
Informally, if the edge relation denotes "friendship", the clustering
coefficient at a vertex :math:`v` is the probability that two acquaintances of
:math:`v` are themselves friends.

More formally:

.. math::

    cc(v)  = \frac{ \| \{ (u,v,w) \in V^3: \ \{u,v\}, \{u, w\}, \{v,w \} \in \
    E \} \| }{\| \{ (u,v,w) \in V^3: \ \{v, u \}, \{v, w\} \in E \} \|}


The toolkit provides the function clustering_coefficient which computes both
local and global clustering coefficients for a given undirected graph.

For more details on the mathematics and applications of clustering
coefficients, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient.

``dict``

        Dictionary of the global clustering coefficient of the graph or,
        if local clustering coefficients are requested, a reference to the frame with local
        clustering coefficients stored at properties at each vertex.
