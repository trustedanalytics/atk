.. function:: join(self, right, left_on, right_on=None, how='inner', name=None)

    |BETA|
    Join operation on one or two frames, creating a new frame.


    :Parameters:

        **right** : Frame

        ..

            Another frame to join with



        **left_on** : str

        ..

            Name of the column in the left frame used to match up the two frames.



        **right_on** : str (default=None)

        ..

            Name of the column in the right frame used to match up the two frames. Default is the same as the left frame.



        **how** : str (default=inner)

        ..

            How to qualify the data to be joined together.  Must be one of the following:  'left', 'right', 'inner', 'outer'.  Default is 'inner'



        **name** : str (default=None)

        ..

            Name of the result grouped frame




    :Returns:

        : Frame

        ..

            A new frame with the results of the join
    Create a new frame from a SQL JOIN operation with another frame.
    The frame on the 'left' is the currently active frame.
    The frame on the 'right' is another frame.
    This method takes a column in the left frame and matches its values
    with a column in the right frame.
    Using the default 'how' option ['inner'] will only allow data in the
    resultant frame if both the left and right frames have the same value
    in the matching column.
    Using the 'left' 'how' option will allow any data in the resultant
    frame if it exists in the left frame, but will allow any data from the
    right frame if it has a value in its column which matches the value in
    the left frame column.
    Using the 'right' option works similarly, except it keeps all the data
    from the right frame and only the data from the left frame when it
    matches.
    The 'outer' option provides a frame with data from both frames where
    the left and right frames did not have the same value in the matching
    column.

    Notes
    -----
    When a column is named the same in both frames, it will result in two
    columns in the new frame.
    The column from the *left* frame (originally the current frame) will be
    copied and the column name will have the string "_L" added to it.
    The same thing will happen with the column from the *right* frame,
    except its name has the string "_R" appended. The order of columns
    after this method is called is not guaranteed.

    It is recommended that you rename the columns to meaningful terms prior
    to using the ``join`` method.
    Keep in mind that unicode in column names will likely cause the
    drop_frames() method (and others) to fail!

    Examples
    --------
    For this example, we will use a Frame *my_frame* accessing a frame with
    columns *a*, *b*, *c*, and a Frame *your_frame* accessing a frame with
    columns *a*, *d*, *e*.
    Join the two frames keeping only those rows having the same value in
    column *a*:

    .. code::

        >>> print my_frame.inspect()

          a:unicode   b:unicode   c:unicode
        /--------------------------------------/
          alligator   bear        cat
          apple       berry       cantaloupe
          auto        bus         car
          mirror      frog        ball

        >>> print your_frame.inspect()

          b:unicode   c:int   d:unicode
        /-------------------------------------/
          berry        5218   frog
          blue            0   log
          bus           871   dog

        >>> joined_frame = my_frame.join(your_frame, 'b', how='inner')

    Now, joined_frame is a Frame accessing a frame with the columns *a*,
    *b*, *c_L*, *ci_R*, and *d*.
    The data in the new frame will be from the rows where column 'a' was
    the same in both frames.

    .. code::

        >>> print joined_frame.inspect()

          a:unicode   b:unicode     c_L:unicode   c_R:int64   d:unicode
        /-------------------------------------------------------------------/
          apple       berry         cantaloupe         5218   frog
          auto        bus           car                 871   dog
