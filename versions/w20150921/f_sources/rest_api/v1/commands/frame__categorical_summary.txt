        occurring values for that column.
        Default is 10.

    threshold *: float*
        Displays levels which are above the threshold percentage with
        respect to the total row count.
        Default is 0.0.

Compute a summary of the data in a column(s) for categorical or numerical data types.
The returned value is a Map containing categorical summary for each specified column.

For each column, levels which satisfy the top k and/or threshold cutoffs are
displayed along with their frequency and percentage occurrence with respect to
the total rows in the dataset.

Performs level pruning first based on top k and then filters
out levels which satisfy the threshold criterion.

Missing data is reported when a column value is empty ("") or null.

All remaining data is grouped together in the Other category and its frequency
and percentage are reported as well.

User must specify the column name and can optionally specify top_k and/or threshold.
