:doc:`EdgeFrame <index>`  filter
********************************

------


.. function:: filter(self, predicate)

    Select all rows which satisfy a predicate.


    :Parameters:

        **predicate** : function

        ..

            |UDF| which evaluates a row to a boolean; rows that answer False are dropped from the Frame


    Modifies the current frame to save defined rows and delete everything
    else.

    Examples
    --------
    For this example, *my_frame* is a Frame object with lots of data for
    the attributes of ``lizards``, ``frogs``, and ``snakes``.
    Get rid of everything, except information about ``lizards`` and
    ``frogs``:

    .. code::

        >>> def my_filter(row):
        ... return row['animal_type'] == 'lizard' or
        ... row['animal_type'] == "frog"

        >>> my_frame.filter(my_filter)

    The frame now only has data about ``lizards`` and ``frogs``.

    More information on a |UDF| can be found at :doc:`/ds_apir`.
