    **data_column** : unicode

    ..

        The column whose median is to be calculated.



    **weights_column** : unicode (default=None)

    ..

        The column that provides weights (frequencies)
        for the median calculation.
        Must contain numerical data.
        Default is all items have a weight of 1.

**Description**

The median is the least value X in the range of the distribution so that
the cumulative weight of values strictly below X is strictly less than half
of the total weight and the cumulative weight of values up to and including X
is greater than or equal to one-half of the total weight.

All data elements of weight less than or equal to 0 are excluded from the
calculation, as are all data elements whose weight is NaN or infinite.
If a weight column is provided and no weights are finite numbers greater
than 0, None is returned.

``dict``

        varies
            The median of the values.
            If a weight column is provided and no weights are finite numbers greater
            than 0, None is returned.
            The type of the median returned is the same as the contents of the data
            column, so a column of Longs will result in a Long median and a column of
            Floats will result in a Float median.
