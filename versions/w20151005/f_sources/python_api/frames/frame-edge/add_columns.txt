.. function:: add_columns(self, func, schema, columns_accessed=None)

    Add columns to current frame.


    :Parameters:

        **func** : UDF

        ..

            User-Defined Function (|UDF|) which takes the values in the row and produces a value, or collection of values, for the new cell(s).



        **schema** : tuple | list of tuples

        ..

            The schema for the results of the |UDF|, indicating the new column(s) to add.  Each tuple provides the column name and data type, and is of the form (str, type).



        **columns_accessed** : list (default=None)

        ..

            List of columns which the |UDF| will access.  This adds significant performance benefit if we know which column(s) will be needed to execute the |UDF|, especially when the frame has significantly more columns than those being used to evaluate the |UDF|.


    Assigns data to column based on evaluating a function for each row.

    Notes
    -----
    1)  The row |UDF| ('func') must return a value in the same format as
        specified by the schema.
        See :doc:`/ds_apir`.
    2)  Unicode in column names is not supported and will likely cause the
        drop_frames() method (and others) to fail!

    Examples
    --------
    Given a Frame *my_frame* identifying a data frame with two int32
    columns *column1* and *column2*.
    Add a third column *column3* as an int32 and fill it with the
    contents of *column1* and *column2* multiplied together:

    .. code::

        >>> my_frame.add_columns(lambda row: row.column1*row.column2,
        ... ('column3', int32))

    The frame now has three columns, *column1*, *column2* and *column3*.
    The type of *column3* is an int32, and the value is the product of
    *column1* and *column2*.

    Add a string column *column4* that is empty:

    .. code::

        >>> my_frame.add_columns(lambda row: '', ('column4', str))

    The Frame object *my_frame* now has four columns *column1*, *column2*,
    *column3*, and *column4*.
    The first three columns are int32 and the fourth column is str.
    Column *column4* has an empty string ('') in every row.

    Multiple columns can be added at the same time.
    Add a column *a_times_b* and fill it with the contents of column *a*
    multiplied by the contents of column *b*.
    At the same time, add a column *a_plus_b* and fill it with the contents
    of column *a* plus the contents of column *b*:

    .. only:: html

        .. code::

            >>> my_frame.add_columns(lambda row: [row.a * row.b, row.a + row.b], [("a_times_b", float32), ("a_plus_b", float32))

    .. only:: latex

        .. code::

            >>> my_frame.add_columns(lambda row: [row.a * row.b, row.a +
            ... row.b], [("a_times_b", float32), ("a_plus_b", float32))

    Two new columns are created, "a_times_b" and "a_plus_b", with the
    appropriate contents.

    Given a frame of data and Frame *my_frame* points to it.
    In addition we have defined a |UDF| *func*.
    Run *func* on each row of the frame and put the result in a new int
    column *calculated_a*:

    .. code::

        >>> my_frame.add_columns( func, ("calculated_a", int))

    Now the frame has a column *calculated_a* which has been filled with
    the results of the |UDF| *func*.

    A |UDF| must return a value in the same format as the column is
    defined.
    In most cases this is automatically the case, but sometimes it is less
    obvious.
    Given a |UDF| *function_b* which returns a value in a list, store
    the result in a new column *calculated_b*:

    .. code::

        >>> my_frame.add_columns(function_b, ("calculated_b", float32))

    This would result in an error because function_b is returning a value
    as a single element list like [2.4], but our column is defined as a
    tuple.
    The column must be defined as a list:

    .. code::

        >>> my_frame.add_columns(function_b, [("calculated_b", float32)])

    To run an optimized version of add_columns, columns_accessed parameter can
    be populated with the column names which are being accessed in |UDF|. This
    speeds up the execution by working on only the limited feature set than the
    entire row.

    Let's say a frame has 4 columns named *a*,*b*,*c* and *d* and we want to add a new column
    with value from column *a* multiplied by value in column *b* and call it *a_times_b*.
    In the example below, columns_accessed is a list with column names *a* and *b*.

    .. code::

        >>> my_frame.add_columns(lambda row: row.a * row.b, ("a_times_b", float32), columns_accessed=["a", "b"])

    add_columns would fail if columns_accessed parameter is not populated with the correct list of accessed
    columns. If not specified, columns_accessed defaults to None which implies that all columns might be accessed
    by the |UDF|.

    More information on a row |UDF| can be found at :doc:`/ds_apir`
