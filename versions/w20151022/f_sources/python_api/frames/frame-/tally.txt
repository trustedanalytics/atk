.. function:: tally(self, sample_col, count_val)

    |BETA|
    Count number of times a value is seen.


    :Parameters:

        **sample_col** : unicode

        ..

            The name of the column from which to compute the cumulative count.



        **count_val** : unicode

        ..

            The column value to be used for the counts.




    :Returns:

        : _Unit

        ..


    A cumulative count is computed by sequentially stepping through the rows,
    observing the column values and keeping track of the number of times the specified
    *count_value* has been seen.

    Examples
    --------
    Consider Frame *my_frame*, which accesses a frame that contains a single
    column *obs*:

    .. code::

        >>> my_frame.inspect()

          obs:int32
        /-----------/
            0
            1
            2
            0
            1
            2

    The cumulative count for column *obs* using *count_value = 1* is obtained by:

    .. code::

        >>> my_frame.tally('obs', '1')

    The Frame *my_frame* accesses a frame which now contains two columns *obs*
    and *obsCumulativeCount*.
    Column *obs* still has the same data and *obsCumulativeCount* contains the
    cumulative counts:

    .. code::

        >>> my_frame.inspect()

          obs:int32        obs_tally:int32
        /----------------------------------/
             0                      0
             1                      1
             2                      1
             0                      1
             1                      2
             2                      2
