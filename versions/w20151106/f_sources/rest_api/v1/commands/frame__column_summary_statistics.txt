:arguments:


    **frame** : Frame

    ..

        <Missing Description>



    **data_column** : unicode

    ..

        The column to be statistically summarized.
        Must contain numerical data; all NaNs and infinite values are excluded
        from the calculation.



    **weights_column** : unicode (default=None)

    ..

        Name of column holding weights of
        column values.



    **use_population_variance** : bool (default=None)

    ..

        If true, the variance is calculated
        as the population variance.
        If false, the variance calculated as the sample variance.
        Because this option affects the variance, it affects the standard
        deviation and the confidence intervals as well.
        Default is false.

**Description**

Notes
-----
Sample Variance
    Sample Variance is computed by the following formula:

    .. math::

        \left( \frac{1}{W - 1} \right) * sum_{i} \
        \left(x_{i} - M \right) ^{2}

    where :math:`W` is sum of weights over valid elements of positive
    weight, and :math:`M` is the weighted mean.

Population Variance
    Population Variance is computed by the following formula:

    .. math::

        \left( \frac{1}{W} \right) * sum_{i} \
        \left(x_{i} - M \right) ^{2}

    where :math:`W` is sum of weights over valid elements of positive
    weight, and :math:`M` is the weighted mean.

Standard Deviation
    The square root of the variance.

Logging Invalid Data
    A row is bad when it contains a NaN or infinite value in either
    its data or weights column.
    In this case, it contributes to bad_row_count; otherwise it
    contributes to good row count.

    A good row can be skipped because the value in its weight
    column is less than or equal to 0.
    In this case, it contributes to non_positive_weight_count, otherwise
    (when the weight is greater than 0) it contributes to
    valid_data_weight_pair_count.

**Equations**

    .. code::

        bad_row_count + good_row_count = # rows in the frame
        positive_weight_count + non_positive_weight_count = good_row_count

    In particular, when no weights column is provided and all weights are 1.0:

    .. code::

        non_positive_weight_count = 0 and
        positive_weight_count = good_row_count

``dict``

        Dictionary containing summary statistics.
        The data returned is composed of multiple components\:

        |   mean : [ double | None ]
        |       Arithmetic mean of the data.
        |   geometric_mean : [ double | None ]
        |       Geometric mean of the data. None when there is a data element <= 0, 1.0 when there are no data elements.
        |   variance : [ double | None ]
        |       None when there are <= 1 many data elements. Sample variance is the weighted sum of the squared distance of each data element from the weighted mean, divided by the total weight minus 1. None when the sum of the weights is <= 1. Population variance is the weighted sum of the squared distance of each data element from the weighted mean, divided by the total weight.
        |   standard_deviation : [ double | None ]
        |       The square root of the variance. None when  sample variance is being used and the sum of weights is <= 1.
        |   total_weight : long
        |       The count of all data elements that are finite numbers. In other words, after excluding NaNs and infinite values.
        |   minimum : [ double | None ]
        |       Minimum value in the data. None when there are no data elements.
        |   maximum : [ double | None ]
        |       Maximum value in the data. None when there are no data elements.
        |   mean_confidence_lower : [ double | None ]
        |       Lower limit of the 95% confidence interval about the mean. Assumes a Gaussian distribution. None when there are no elements of positive weight.
        |   mean_confidence_upper : [ double | None ]
        |       Upper limit of the 95% confidence interval about the mean. Assumes a Gaussian distribution. None when there are no elements of positive weight.
        |   bad_row_count : [ double | None ]
        |       The number of rows containing a NaN or infinite value in either the data or weights column.
        |   good_row_count : [ double | None ]
        |       The number of rows not containing a NaN or infinite value in either the data or weights column.
        |   positive_weight_count : [ double | None ]
        |       The number of valid data elements with weight > 0. This is the number of entries used in the statistical calculation.
        |   non_positive_weight_count : [ double | None ]
        |       The number valid data elements with finite weight <= 0.
